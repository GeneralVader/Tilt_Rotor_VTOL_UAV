# Tilt_rotor_VTOL_UAV
This repository presents the conceptual design approach to a Tilt-Rotor Vertical Take-Off and Landing UAV with Unconventional Empennage Configuration. The configuration selection and other configurations of the UAV, were a result of background research and insights of commercially available VTOL UAVs. This model was designed for the IIT Bombay TechFest event, ALVTOLA.
The model has been designed in SolidWorks 2018 and hence the SW part and assembly files will only open in the software of the same or later versions. STEP files have also been provided for people who'd like to use the model in previous version and/or in other CAD softwares.

## Introduction
Transitional Aircrafts are aerial vehicles that can perform as fixed wing aircrafts/UAVs, and also as a rotorcraft, by transitioning between these modes of flight when desired or needed. When TA operates in rotorcraft mode, it can hover, fly at low speeds in any direction (forward or sideways), perform some missions that are impossible or difficult for a fixed wing aircrafts like Aerial Photography or Surveillance, and also makes it possible for the aircraft to Vertically Take-off and Land (VTOL).

## Configuration Selection and Justification
1. VTOL Mode
Vyan takes off and lands vertically with the help of the four ducted propellers mounted on the twin boom, which in turn mounted below the wing. Once the UAV starts the transition, the front mounted propellers starts to tilt in the vertical plane, to provide the required horizontal thrust required for the cruise flight, and the rear mounted rotors are switched off in order to reduce the power consumption.
2. Wing
In order to avoid the protuberance, drag, a monoplane high wing configuration was chosen.
3. Empennage
Inverted 'V' Tail was considered to be apt for the transitional aircraft, considering the reduction of drag by almost 20% due to its less wetted area compared to conventional tails and 'T' Tails.
4. Fuselage
Design of the fuselage was done based on drag reduction, weight reduction while having enough compartment to mount wing, accommodate propulsion system, power plant, payload and electronic sensors to be used for surveillance. 

Below we discuss each component of the VTOL individually.
